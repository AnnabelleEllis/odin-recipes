    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>When we lived in Kingston, my favourite time for making ackee and saltfish were Saturday mornings after the weekly Coronation market trip. We would have what I dubbed “Market Breakfast” which basically was whatever I’d bought that morning that was the best of the best. It was always a delight when ackee was in season.

        In my ackee and saltfish I always put:
        onions and garlic (almost no dish starts in my house without that);
        escallion (or green onions) and thyme;
        scotch bonnet pepper and pimento (Jamaican allspice)
