First Odin Project: HTML Foundations
Basic HTML Page created: index.html
created links from the root html to other html recipe files in the recipes directory. 
Each page detailed a different recipe. It consited of an imge, the description, the ingredients and the steps to make the recipe. 

Note to Self: I can add links to go back. I will update with css styling later on in the couse.
